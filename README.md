# Another Simple Bytecode
A simple bytecode language I designed with an included assembler and virtual machine interpreter.

Features include:
* 10 32-bit free use registers (r0-r9)
* Ability to input/output characters and numbers to the console as well as print a string to the console
* Most standard operations
* Ability to access memory to store/load variables
